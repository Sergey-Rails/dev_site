reSpree is written and maintained by a community of volunteer software professionals. We have written this software in our free time and we our sharing it with you free of charge.  You're welcome.

## Supported Versions

Community support is provided for the current master branch as well as the last three [minor versions](/versioning). We will not accept any pull requests for versions older than this. It does not matter if your pull request is a new feature, an enhancement of an existing feature, bug fix, or security patch.  It will be rejected. No exceptions.

Why are we so strict with this policy? We are trying to strike a balance between stability and innovation. We feel it is important to drive Spree forward by constantly improving it and adding new features. On the other hand, we are volunteers and we can't maintain dozens of versions of the software over an extended period of time. Generally if you start a project using the latest released version of Spree, and you never upgrade to a newer version, it will still be supported for roughly the next eighteen months (based on our typical release schedule).
