We do not have a specific release schedule. Majore releases take time and they are done when they are ready. Minor releases are done periodically once we have enough bug fixes and new non-breaking features to justify them. Patch releases are done periodically on an as needed basis or whenever there are crucial security bugs. Historically we have done one or two minor release every year and one major release every eighteen months.

## Versions

We use semantic versioning for our releases. See our [versioning policy](/versioning) for more details.

## Source Code

The source code for each release can be found on Github in the [spree project](https://github.com/spree/spree). The list of releases along with release notes can be found on the [Github release page](https://github.com/spree/spree/releases). Each release also cotains a "stable" branch. These releases are used for bug fixes and security patches so it should be safe to reference a stable branch in your Gemfile.

Stable branches and tagged versions are never deleted from Github. This allows developers to reference them in a Gemfile. Each release is also [tagged in Github](https://github.com/spree/spree/tags).

## Support

Releases are supported by the community. Support for older releases is not guaranteed. Please see the [maintenance policy](/maintenance) for more details.
