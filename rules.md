This document will describe the rules and guidelines we use to either accept or
deny a pull request. Some rules warrant more discussion from the core team before
it get's accepted.

## Ruby Styleguide and code quality

We follow the [Thoughtbot Styleguide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/style/README.md)
. This will be enforced for every pull request. We use [HoundCI](https://houndci.com) for that, so when
you violate a style rule there will be a comment on that specific line in your pull request.

Before you send a pull request, there are a few things that you can do yourself
to make sure that the rules are not broken.

#### Rubocop
HoundCI uses [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to check for ruby syntax,
we added the [Rubocop rules](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/.rubocop.yml)
in Spree so you can run the checks manually before submitting a pull request.
See the Rubocop [documentation](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop#basic-usage) on how to run it locally.

### CodeClimate code quality
We also run [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/github/spree/spree) on all pull requests, low quality code needs to be refactored before we consider accepting the pull request.

### Ruby documentation with YARD
Add comments to the public interface in the ruby files with YARD, for usage see the [YARD Getting Started](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) page.

### Bullet
The [Bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet) gem is available in the sandbox. That way you can test if your changes
introduce performance problems. To use it generate a sandbox and run it on your
localmachine. You will see the bullet reporting on screen, including suggestions
on how to improve the performance issue detected. TODO make the sandbox rake task inject the bullet configuration to enable it by default.


## Rules

### 1. Don’t decorate the state machine.
We are moving away from the complex and low performance state machine logic. We do not accept any new changes or usages for the statemachine logic.

### 2. No callbacks.
Similar to number 1 above, we are moving away from the heavily used callbacks to prevent the cascading touching and other low performance resulting in using these callbacks.

### 3. Public API changes will need justification.
The stable releases are named stable for a reason, let's keep it that way. Any public API (breaking) change needs proper discussion before accepting it. We will never merge these changes in the stable branches.

### 4. Limit (avoid) adding actions to controllers & models.
Use concerns or behaviour classes to add logic, we need thin controllers and small models.

### 5. Performance can’t take a hit.
No need to explain this :)

### 6. No additional queries.
See number 5.

### 7. Breaking other specs.
No pull request with breaking specs is getting in, make sure you don't break other specs as well.

### 8. Use of non-localized strings.
We need to make sure that every string in the system can be localized. So use the translation files.

### 9. Destruction or change data.
Be very very carefull here, every change that adds destructive methods or changes existing data needs to have a solid review before getting in.

### 10. Adding new gem dependencies.
We need te keep spree as light on dependencies as possible.

### 11. API endpoints need to proper authentication/authorization
Securtiy is major thing in ecommerce, make sure you use the supplied cancan authorization calls. TODO link to documentation here.

### 12. No more class_eval!
Since we dropped the ruby 1.9 support on the latest Spree master, there is no more excuse not to use the Model#prepend approach. [Sample on extending classes](http://guides.spreecommerce.com/developer/logic.html#extending-classes)
